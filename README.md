  This Vending Machine project simulates the functionality of a real-world vending machine. Users can interact with the machine by inserting coins, selecting products, and viewing their selection on the screen. It's a fun project that demonstrates the power of React for building interactive user interfaces.

## Features:

- *Coin Insertion:* Users can insert coins into the virtual vending machine by selecting the corresponding coin image.

- *Product Selection:* Products are displayed as clickable items. Users can click on a product to select it and the available quantities can be seen in each item

- *Product Display:* The selected product is visually displayed on the screen, providing a user-friendly interface.

- *Credit and Change Calculation:* The project now includes a feature that shows the total credits available after coin insertion and calculates the change to be returned after a product is selected. Users can easily keep track of their credits and change on the screen.

 - *Credit Refund:* If a user decides not to purchase a product, they can get their credits back by clicking on a dedicated button. This feature allows users to buy multiple products at a time, using remaining credits from a previous purchase.

This project is a great example of how React can be used to create dynamic and interactive web applications. It's perfect for learning and experimenting with React's component-based architecture and state management.
